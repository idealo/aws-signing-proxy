![Github Package](https://github.com/idealo/aws-signing-proxy/workflows/goreleaser/badge.svg)
![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/idealo/aws-signing-proxy/workflows/Docker%20Image%20CI/badge.svg)

A transparent proxy which forwards and signs http requests to AWS services.

Supported AWS credentials:

* [Static environment based AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-set)
* [AWS credential files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where)
* Fetching short-lived credentials from a vault set up with
  an [AWS secrets engine & sts-assumerole](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws#sts-assumerole)
* Fetching short-lived credentials from AWS via a OAuth2 authorization server
  and [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/)

For ready-to-use binaries have a look at releases. Additionally, we provide a _Docker image_ which can be used both in a
test setup and as a sidecar in kubernetes.

In addition to the proxy you may also use `vault-env-cred-provider` as an
[credential provider for AWS tooling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html)
.

‚ùóNOTE: the provided pre-built mac os binaries might fail with name resolution issues on your apple machine if you are
using a (corporate) VPN. This will not occur on linux/windows/docker. If you are affected: either use the provided
docker image or build the binaries on your machine.

# Build & Run

## Local

### Build

#### aws-signing-proxy

1. Change directory to `cmd/aws-signing-proxy`
2. Run `go build`

#### vault-env-cred-provider

1. Change directory to `cmd/vault-env-cred-provider`
2. Run `go build`

### Run

#### aws-signing-proxy with credentials via vault

Execute the binary with the required environment variables set:

```
ASP_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=vault; \
ASP_VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN=someTokenWhichAllowsYouToAccessVault; \
ASP_VAULT_URL=https://vault.url.invalid; \
ASP_TARGET_URL=https://someAWSServiceSupportingSignedHttpRequests; \
ASP_SERVICE=s3; \
AWS_REGION=eu-central-1; \
ASP_VAULT_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/an-aws-engine-in-vault/creds/a-role-defined-aws; \
aws-signing-proxy
```

#### aws-signing-proxy with credentials via OIDC

Execute the binary with either the required environment variables set or via cli flags:

```
ASP_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=oidc; \
ASP_TARGET_URL=https://someAWSServiceSupportingSignedHttpRequests; \
ASP_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::123456242:role/some-access-role; \
ASP_OPEN_ID_AUTH_SERVER_URL="https://your-oauth2-authorization-server/eg/aws/token/"; \
ASP_OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth2-client; \
ASP_OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET=someverysecurepassword; \
aws-signing-proxy
```

#### vault-env-cred-provider

This program can be used as
a [credential provider for AWS tooling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html)
. Setting it up is a two-step process:

1. Export the required env variables:

```
export ASP_VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN=someTokenWhichAllowsYouToAccessVault
export ASP_VAULT_URL=https://vault.url.invalid
export ASP_VAULT_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/an-aws-engine-in-vault/creds/a-role-defined-aws
```

2. Create an aws config file with the following contents:

```
[some-aws-profile-name]
credential_process = /path/to/vault-env-cred-provider
```

3. Use AWS cli or sdk using this profile name e.g. some-aws-profile-name.

Note that:

* You may name the AWS profile `default` so that you don't need to specify which profile to use when using the AWS
  SDK/CLI.
* There is no need to specify AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID etc.

### Docker

You can find the built image at: https://hub.docker.com/r/idealo/aws-signing-proxy/
Make sure to provide all required ENV variables or flags!
